                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Throughout college, I noticed a penchant for courses that are based on layered architecture and object-oriented programming, which is why I gained a lot of knowledge of C++, C# and Java. Also, I enjoyed learning the C and Assembly programming languages as they provide a very close connection with the hardware and the security branch.</p>
